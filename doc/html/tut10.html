<p>
Co-routine sequencing is sometimes considered as a "poor mans
concurrency."  This is hardly fair, since there is a trade off between
the need for concurrency control and the flexibility in
synchronization.  Co-routines represent the trade-off where
synchronization is simple, since "almost everything is a critical
region."  Using concurrency makes it harder to ensure correct sharing
of data, but on the other hand it its sometimes easier to ensure
progress in the program as a whole, because some thread will run as
long as any thread can do anything.  
</p>

<p>
In both cases, the modeling relation sometimes strongly suggests that
alternating (co-routine) sequencing or concurrent sequencing is the
natural approach to take.  After all, the world <em>is</em> massively
concurrent!  On the other hand, it gets more complicated, or at least
less customary, for the programmer to understand what is going on.
</p>

<h3 class="pagetitle">How does it look?</h3>

<p>
Both to get co-routine sequencing and concurrent sequencing,
the notion of <i>component</i> is needed.  A traditional BETA
syntax for expressing this is the <code>"|"</code> marker, e.g.:
</p>

  
<p>
  <div align="center">
    <table border=2 cellpadding=10 bgcolor="#FEFEFF">
      <tr><td><code>&lt;Names&gt; ":" "@" "|" &lt;Merge&gt;</code></td></tr>
    </table>
  </div>
</p>

<p>
This syntax has been preserved in <font class="gbeta">gbeta</font>, even though it has been
reinterpreted.  The full set of declarations was listed 
<a href="javascript:top.display.tuttopics.tut_activate(3);">earlier</a>, and they all include the <code>"|"</code>. 
</p>

<p>
In traditional BETA, the concept of component is at the same level as
the concept of object, i.e. objects and components are fundamentally
different things.  In <font class="gbeta">gbeta</font>, the notion of component has been
subordinated the notion of types, and the component properties
(notably the posession of an execution stack) is associated with a 
<a href="javascript:top.display.tuttopics.tut_activate(16);">basic pattern</a> called <code>component</code>.  The
<code>"|"</code> marker is reinterpreted as a type constraint which
ensures that <code>component</code> is present.
</p>

<h3 class="pagetitle">Example 8</h3>

<p>
As an example, we take a very famous algorithm which demonstrates that
co-routines is sometimes the most natural expression of alternating
processes, a slight variation of the version from 
<a href="javascript:top.display.tuttopics.tut_activate(1);"><i>Object-Oriented Programming in the BETA Programming Language</i></a>:
