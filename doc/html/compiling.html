<p>
If you have <a href="javascript:top.topics.activate(7);">downloaded</a> the soure code, and you have
access to a <a href="http://daimi.au.dk/~beta/Daimi/index.html" target="_top"
   >Mjolner BETA System</a> compiler, you can compile <font class="gbeta">gbeta</font>, and
hence you can perform language design experiments with it.  Since I'd
enjoy cooperating about such endeavors, don't hesitate to
<a href="mailto:eernst@cs.au.dk">ask me</a> if you experience
problems in doing so!
</p>

<p>
Note that some special considerations are needed in connection with
<a href="#windows">compilation on Windows</a> platforms.
</p>

<p>
Assuming you have installed <font class="gbeta">gbeta</font> in your home directory, you
can compile <font class="gbeta">gbeta</font> like this:
</p>

  
<p>
  <div align="center">
    <table border=2 cellpadding=10 bgcolor="#FEFEFF">
      <tr><td><code>cd $HOME/gbeta-1.9.11/src/main<br>beta -lq gbeta</code></td></tr>
    </table>
  </div>
</p>

<p>
This will take some time.  The binary created by this compilation must
be moved to the <code>bin</code> directory of your <font class="gbeta">gbeta</font>
installation, and it must be named in a way which shows what platform
it belongs to, i.e. you must execute one of the following commands:
</p>

<p>
On Linux: 
<p>
  <div align="center">
    <table border=2 cellpadding=10 bgcolor="#FEFEFF">
      <tr><td><code>mv gbeta ../../bin/gbeta-1.9.11-i386-linux-elf-bin</code></td></tr>
    </table>
  </div>
</p>
</p>

<p>
On Sun: 
<p>
  <div align="center">
    <table border=2 cellpadding=10 bgcolor="#FEFEFF">
      <tr><td><code>mv gbeta ../../bin/gbeta-1.9.11-sparc-sun-solaris-bin</code></td></tr>
    </table>
  </div>
</p>
</p>


<p>
That's it!  Now, assuming that you have adjusted your path to include
the <font class="gbeta">gbeta</font> executable as explained under <a href="javascript:top.topics.activate(8);">installation</a>,
you can <a href="javascript:top.topics.activate(1);">try out</a> your new <font class="gbeta">gbeta</font>,
to see if your installation is basically sound.
</p>

<a name="windows"><h3 class="pagetitle">Special Considerations on Windows</h3>

<p>
Note that the Windows version of the source code can <em>not</em>
co-exist with versions for other platforms since Windows
does not distinguish between upper and lower case letters in
filenames, and generated filenames (sitting inside some generated
files) will consequently have modified case, and then the other
platforms cannot use those files.  To avoid these problems, just
install the Windows version in its own directory or on another disk,
keeping the files entirely separate.  This will typically be
the case for most installations under Windows, because a Windows disk
is often not shared with computers running other operating systems.
</p>

<p>
Other than that, the approach is similar to the other platforms:
</p>

  
<p>
  <div align="center">
    <table border=2 cellpadding=10 bgcolor="#FEFEFF">
      <tr><td><code>cd c:\gbeta-1.9.11\src\main<br>beta -lq gbeta</code></td></tr>
    </table>
  </div>
</p>

<p>
and:
</p>

  
<p>
  <div align="center">
    <table border=2 cellpadding=10 bgcolor="#FEFEFF">
      <tr><td><code>mv gbeta ..\..\bin\gbetabin.exe</code></td></tr>
    </table>
  </div>
</p>

<h3 class="pagetitle">Creating Variants</h3>

<p>
Of course there could be myriads of different ways to modify
<font class="gbeta">gbeta</font>.  If you want to experiment with the grammar of the
language, you need the <code>dogram</code> tool which is delivered
with the Mjolner BETA System.  This tool will generate grammar tables
from your customized version of the involved grammars, and
<font class="gbeta">gbeta</font> cannot use a changed grammar without having these
generated files.  The script <code>$GBETA_ROOT/bin/dogrammar</code>
will help you getting this right.
</p>

<p>
Changing the grammar of the language is of course potentially a very
deep change which requires a lot of changes to the static analysis and
run-time system of <font class="gbeta">gbeta</font>.  Don't hesitate to tell me about your
adventures if you are doing such things!
