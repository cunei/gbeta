<h3 class="pagetitle">Binaries</h3>

A number of binary versions are available, for the following
platforms (with a few details from the command <code>uname</code>
given in the parentheses):

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="download/gbeta-1.9.11-i386-linux-elf-bin.tgz">Linux/x86</a>
   <small>(Linux 2.4.23 i686 unknown)</small>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="download/gbeta-1.9.11-sparc-sun-solaris-bin.tgz">Solaris</a>
   <small>(SunOS 5.8 sun4u sparc)</small>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="download/gbeta-1.9.11-windows-bin.zip">Windows</a>
   <small>(XP)</small>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
You need one or more of the above binary distributions unless you want
to compile <font class="gbeta">gbeta</font>.  The binary for Linux should work on almost all
versions of Linux running on an i386 platform, and the binary for
Solaris should work on a wide range of SPARC/Solaris platforms.  The
binary for Windows is tested on XP but should work on NT/2000, too.
Unfortunately, there is no exact list of platforms where it works,
because I do not have access to many platforms for testing.
</p>

<p>
If you get binaries for more than one platform, they can coexist in the
same directories (except for Windows which must be installed
separately).  A shell script is used to detect what platform is
currently being used, and the relevant binary is executed (this
shell script does not work on Windows, but an MS-DOS style batch file
is provided).
</p>

<p>
When you have fetched the files you need, you can proceed with the
<a href="javascript:top.topics.activate(8);">installation</a>.
</p>

<h3 class="pagetitle">Source Code</h3>

<p>
You can download the <font class="gbeta">gbeta</font>
<a href="download/gbeta-1.9.11-src.tgz">source code</a> (or, for
Windows, the <a href="download/gbeta-1.9.11-src.zip">source code in a
zip-file</a>), and this will enable you to compile <font class="gbeta">gbeta</font> and to make
whatever experiments with it you want.  Moreover, the source code can
give you detailed information if you want to know more about how such
a language can be statically analyzed, and how it can be executed.

Since <font class="gbeta">gbeta</font> was implemented in (standard) <a href="javascript:top.topics.activate(14);">BETA</a>, you
will need a BETA compiler if you want to <a href="javascript:top.topics.activate(9);">compile</a>
your own version of <font class="gbeta">gbeta</font>.
</p>

<p>
You can now proceed with the <a href="javascript:top.topics.activate(8);">installation</a>.
